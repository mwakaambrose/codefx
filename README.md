# CodeFX
Hello and welcome to codefx repository.
CodeFX is a simple java editor which is being developed by 
Mwaka Ambrose as an open source project for the students of faculty of
science at Gulu University. Its not Official i.e. Its not being supported by the 
university. Its my hope tthough that someone at the University will get interested 
and join in the project.
